# Duda Preview

Use this tool to quicly check your Duda site without publishing it.

## How it works

**!! Duda Preview was developed to help designers checking their site from an actual device !!**

Since Duda is adaptive and not responsive, when selecting Mobile, Tablet, or Desktop you will be redirected to the preview for that device. If you want to check the Standard Duda Preview (and see Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile) all together, you can check "Use Standard Duda Preview".

## How to use it

[Duda Preview](https://spotzerdesign.github.io/duda-preview/) is optimised for mobile:

1. click on the link
2. paste the Duda ID
3. select the device you want to preview
4. (Optional) Click on "Use Standard Duda Preview"
5. click on "Go to Preview"
